Project Name : Simon Game

Description : I tried to recreate Simon Game challenge. Its a game which creates a series of tones and colours and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
              If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

Concepts used : This project is done by using "jQuery".
